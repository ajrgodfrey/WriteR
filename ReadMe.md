Time to get the main script out there for consumption and contributions.
- added Program folder. This can be used without Python installed. Copy the folder somewhere useful and look for WriteR.exe inside it.
- The wholly self contained executable called WriteR.exe can be used instead of the set of files in the Program folder. It is suggested that this may load more slowly but I couldn't see the difference. Take it alone and put in a folder that is on the path.
