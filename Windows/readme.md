# WriteR for Windows

A decent attempt has been made to make an executable and and installation executable version of WriteR for Windows users.

This folder contains the tools used to make the  compiled executable and the installer file.

It is intended for developers, not users.

If you do not know how to use these files, please steer away from them.



## Using the files

The files in this folder of the repo need to be moved to the folder above the repo when it is pulled down to a developer's machine, so that the commands in them do not affect the repo itself. You will see reference to a a folder called "PackageFiles" which is the top of the repo as it was originally set up, way, way back when it all began. If you call the repo something else, then you will need to edit the files accordingly.
